## Overview
The Password Strength Tester is a tool designed to educate users about the security of their passwords and provide actionable suggestions to improve them. This program aims to enhance password security by analyzing the strength of user-input passwords and offering tips to make them more resilient against attacks.

## Features
Password Strength Analysis: Evaluates passwords based on length, complexity, and use of common patterns.
Real-Time Feedback: Provides immediate suggestions for improving password security.
Common Password Detection: Warns users if their password matches commonly used or compromised passwords.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design, making it accessible for all users.
## Background
Alpha-numeric passwords can be secure, but often fail due to human predictability. Short passwords and those lacking symbols, numbers, or capitalization are especially vulnerable to brute force attacks. By leveraging patterns found in compromised password databases, attackers have a significant advantage. This project aims to counteract these vulnerabilities by guiding users toward creating stronger passwords.

How It Works
Users input a password.
The program evaluates the password based on:
Length
Use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
Comparison against a database of common passwords
## Feedback is provided, including:
A strength score
Specific recommendations to improve the password
Testing
During testing, the program successfully:

## Identified weak and strong passwords.
Provided relevant tips for improving password strength.
Displayed warnings for passwords found in the common password database.
Received positive feedback for its ease of use and clarity.
## Future Enhancements
Password Munging: Detect and suggest improvements for passwords that replace letters with symbols (e.g., "Pa$$word").
Pattern Recognition: Compare passwords against lists of common nouns and names.
Enhanced Tokenization: Analyze components of passwords for potential weaknesses.
Additional Feedback: Incorporate advanced metrics for password strength scoring.
